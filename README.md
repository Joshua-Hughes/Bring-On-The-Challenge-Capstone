## Bring on the Challenge ##
Do you have a favorite game that you've played through too many times to count? Do you want to play again, but you want to spice up how you play the game? No ideas? No problem! Bring on the Challenge, BotC for short, aims to bring the more hardcore gamers together to share their challenges with others who seek a new way to look at their favorite games.

## Function of the App ##
Users can create an account to submit their own challenges and save ones they like. Games can be searched by name through an extensive list of over 400,000 games.

## Getting Started ##
To run BotC locally, clone the project by running the following command in your terminal:
> `git clone git@github.com:Joshua-Hughes/Bring-On-The-Challenge-Capstone.git`

Once cloned, run:
> `npm install`

Which will install the libraries and other dependencies used by BotC

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

## Scripts ##
In the project directory in terminal, run:
>`npm start`

This will run the app in `https://localhost:3000` to view the site in your browser.
Every change made will reload the page. Any errors will show in the console.

## Database ##
The JSON server must be run in another terminal instance.
Navigate to the api folder of the application and run:
>`json-server -p 8088 -w database.json`

## Acknowledgments ##
Thanks to all the friends who struggled on their own code alongside me. It's comforting to have others suffer with you.
